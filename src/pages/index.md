# Mykal's Component Library

This is a collection of styles, components, and shared frontend utilities that I use throughout my projects.

> **Note:** The component library is still very early days. I'm basically just trying to centralize all my CSS so I always have a solid set of components and CSS utils to use off the bat.

## Why Build A Personal Component Library

With each new project, I usually go through the whole song and dance of:

1. Choosing a CSS Library, or starting from scratch
2. Building out very similiar components/mixins
3. Implementing *basically* the same set of things, slightly differently, every time. 
4. Wondering why I don't just standardize my CSS and common components.

By having a semi-standardized set of CSS / components for my projects, I should be able to avoid those steps on each new project.
